# Predictive Analytics Projects
This repository showcases a collection of Predictive Analytics projects developed as part of Data Science practice using Machine Learning models. Each project is designed to solve real-world problems by applying supervised learning techniques to make informed predictions based on historical data.
The projects cover various domains including customer churn prediction, student admission forecasting, and fraud detection, highlighting the complete workflow from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model selection, evaluation, and deployment-ready outputs.

Key features:

- End-to-end pipelines using Python and essential ML libraries
- Cleaned and well-structured datasets from Kaggle and other open sources
- Performance comparison of top models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Visual insights through EDA and result plots
- Best-fit model chosen based on accuracy and real-world applicability

These projects aim to demonstrate practical skills in using Machine Learning for predictive tasks and can serve as strong examples for portfolios, case studies, or academic purposes.
